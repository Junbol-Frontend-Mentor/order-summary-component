## My process

### ðŸ›  Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup ðŸ§¾
- Sass(SCSS) Flexbox ðŸŽ¨
- BEM (Block.Element.Modifier)ðŸ§¾
- Mobile-first workflow ðŸ“±
- GIT/GitHub ðŸ§¾ðŸŒŽ
- PowerShell (CLI) ðŸ§¾
- Javascript ðŸ¤–ðŸš€

### What I learned

- Stop using fa-2x to enlarge these icons, use css rules instead.

- On divs you need to add tabindex="0".

- Be careful your mobile rules don't overide your desktop rules.

- Working with the Grid was a challenge.

```



```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.

### Useful resources
